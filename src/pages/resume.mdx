## Work Experience  

<ResumeRow left="SeatGeek – New York City, NY" right="June 2025 – August 2025" />  
*Software Engineering Intern – FanX Checkout Team*  
- Launched Accelerated Checkout experiment (persisting user data across sessions) that improved back-to-back **conversion rates by 7%**, reduced average **checkout steps by 14%**, and doubled discount code usage, validated via Optimizely, Eppo, and Mixpanel.
- Implemented Redux **middleware** to reconcile unexpected API response changes during checkout, handling numerous edge cases that previously caused **fatal errors** and session termination.
- **Enhanced error handling & UX polish:** improved payment method sorting logic, clarified account linking errors, fixed infinite submission loops, corrected accessibility and mobile UI issues, and moved cart validation to backend to avoid caching issues.
- Reduced technical debt by refactoring legacy components, deprecating outdated feature flags and interfaces, and supporting the migration to a new stateful checkout API built on **FastAPI**.

<ResumeRow left="SIGGRAPH – Vancouver, BC" right="August 2025" />  
*Student Volunteer – SIGGRAPH 2025*  
- Assisted with conference programs and organization, contributing **16 hours of volunteering** over 6 days.  

<ResumeRow left="Quaternion Entertainment – Remote" right="January 2020 – March 2023" />  
*Scripting and User Interface Design – Game Development Team*  
- Co-founded ROBLOX game development studio, amassing **20M+** plays, **15k+** member community, and **2.8k** DAU at its peak
- Earned **~$24,000** from a 30% share of profits via a custom in-game store.  
- Built an **anti-cheat system** detecting unnatural player behaviors, reducing cheating reports by **~60%**.

<ResumeRow left="Personal Website" right="May 2024 – Present" extras="Vercel, React, Tailwind, Next.js, Nextra, MDX" />  
- Streamlined page creation using **Nextra + MDX** for customizable and user-friendly pages.  
- Integrated React components for LaTeX, GLSL shaders, and sheet music.  
- Deployed on Vercel with optimized server-side rendering for performance.  

<ResumeRow left="StudentVerifier" right="January 2025 – April 2025" extras="Python, PostgreSQL, smtplib, discord.py, psycopg2" />  
- Built a Discord bot to verify University of Michigan students via the **MCommunity API** and student emails.  
- Used an SMTP server to send one-time codes with smtplib.  
- Linked Discord user IDs to student emails with PostgreSQL to prevent duplicate accounts.  

<ResumeRow left="Ocean Simulation" right="April 2024 – July 2024" extras="C++20, OpenGL 4.6, GLFW, GLM, CMake" />  
- Implemented **compute shaders** for wave displacement, achieving a **600% speedup** over CPU methods.  
- Added **tessellation shaders** for efficient rendering of an infinite ocean.  
- Developed a **voxel-based flotation model** for drag and buoyancy calculations.
