# Your Name

Hey, I'm Tanner Aslan.

I'm a junior studying a B.A. in Computer Science at Northwestern University, but I'm originally from Kentucky. I'm a transfer student from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor.

I started my CS journey with game development, but I'm now interested in full stack development and graphics programming.

This last summer, I was a software engineering intern at **SeatGeek** in NYC, where I was on the checkout team. 

I like building things and exploring ways to integrate WebGL into website design. Currently, I'm working on **[**shadercn.com**](https://shadercn.com)**, an open-source React component library for adding shaders to your website. Outside of computers, I also play the violin and enjoy composing music.

Outside of work, I play the violin and enjoy composing music as a hobby.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Typescript**. It's deployed on **Vercel** and the source code is available on **[**Github**](https://github.com/tanneraslan/website).**
